    <h1>Euclids theorem</h1>
<!--<p>05 Jul 2024 - H.I.</p>--> 

<p>Proof that there are infinitly many primes. 
<br /></p>

<h2 id="proof-euclid">Proof (Euclid)</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suppose there were only a finite number of prime numbers \(p_1,p_2, ..., p_n\). Now we define P as follows: \(P := p_1 \cdot p_2 \; \cdot \; ...\; \cdot \; p_n + 1\). That means P is the product of all primes plus one. <br /></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If P is prime, then we found another prime, which contradicts our assumption that all prime numbers were already in the product P.<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If P is not prime, it has a primfactorization and therefore a prime factor q from our list would divide P. This means q obviously divides the product of all primes, because it is in the product. But it also divides P, which means that q must divide 1. This is obviously a contradiction since no prime divides 1.</p>
