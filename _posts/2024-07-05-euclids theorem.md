Proof that there are infinitly many primes. 
<br>

## Proof (Euclid) 


 >Suppose there were only a finite number of prime numbers $$p_1,p_2, ..., p_n$$. Now we define P as follows: $$P := p_1 \cdot p_2 \; \cdot \; ...\; \cdot \; p_n + 1$$. That means P is the product of all primes plus one. <br>

>If P is prime, then we found another prime, which contradicts our assumption that all prime numbers were already in the product P.<br>

>If P is not prime, it has a primfactorization and therefore a prime factor q from our list would divide P. This means q obviously divides the product of all primes, because it is in the product. But it also divides P, which means that q must divide 1. This is obviously a contradiction since no prime divides 1.
